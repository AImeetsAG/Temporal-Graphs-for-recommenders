## Motivation and goal

" Nearly 616.2 million people listen to their favorite artists or discover new ones via online streaming platforms "[^statista]. Hence, streaming platforms seek to increase enhance the user experience by offering personalized music recommendations, moreover, users value personalization as a top feature [^spotify]. At the same time, music streaming services are able to track individual preferences meticulously, thus, a growing volume of data on  multiple user's musical preferences is available.
In response, we aimed to develop a recommendation model that predicts the genres a user is expected to like.

## Dataset
We worked with _tgbn-genre_ dataset, a temporal evolving graph from Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) [^huang23]. The grapgh consists of 992 users and 513 music genre represented as nodes and weighted edges that indicates a user listens to a music genre at a given time. The temporal graph evolves over the span of 4 years and 4 months approximately. This dataset was generated by merging the LastFM dataset[^last_fm] and million songs[^million] dataset with some preprocessing. The LastFM dataset has data on 992 users listening to songs on the last.fm website along with the timestamps of the songs play. The million songs dataset has data on songs and their respective genre/tags along with the weights assigned to each genre/tag. The dataset posed a challenge since the description given by the creators of the dataset did not match it. Additionally, it has anomalies and multiple duplicates. The _tgbn-genre_ dataset was then processed into a dynamical _frequency interaction matrix_ where the interaction of each user and each genre is normalized over the span of a week. We train our models on this second dataset. Nevertheless, we explore the first dataset to comprehend the second one.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Modelling Approach
Our goal is to predict  the frequency interaction vector of users in the test dataset. After the exploratory data analysis, we proceeded with basic time series models for the prediction.
