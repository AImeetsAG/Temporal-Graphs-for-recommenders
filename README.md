## Motivation and goal
The tgbn-genre dataset can be interpreted as a bipartite graph of users and genre with edges as the interaction and edge weights as the weight of the song belonging to that genre. The tgbn-genre dataset was then processed to come up with the user genre frequency interaction vector with a window of 7 days. 
Our goal was to predict the frequency interaction vector of users in the test dataset which consisted of about 6 months. After the data analysis, we proceeded with basic time series models for the prediction. 

## Methodology
Time series


## Dataset
The tgbn-genre dataset consists of 992 users music genre interactions over a period of 4 years and approximately 4 months. This dataset was generated by merging the LastFM dataset and million songs dataset with some preprocessing. The LastFM dataset has data on 992 users listening to songs on the last.fm website along with the timestamps of the songs play. The million songs dataset has data on songs and their respective genre/tags along with the weights assigned to each genre/tag. After the preprocessing, the tgbn-dataset consists of the 992 users and their interaction with 513 genres over the timeperiod in the lastfm dataset.
