\section{Dataset}
	
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\href{https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGB/blob/main/tgb/datasets/dataset_scripts/tgbn-genre.py}{\tt{tgbn-genre}} \cite{tgbn-genre}. Paraphrasing \cite{H_web:2023} (\url{https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/docs/nodeprop/#tgbn-genre}): a bipartite and weighted interaction network between users and music genres, representing users and music genres as nodes, where an interaction denotes a user listening to a music genre at a given time. Edge weights indicate the percentage of a song belonging to a specific genre. The dataset is derived by linking songs from the LastFM-song-listens dataset with music genres from the million-song dataset. 

\end{itemize}
	
\section{Industry value}

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemTitle{Improved recommendation systems:} We aim to enhance recommendation systems for streaming services like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube. By predicting which set of music/movie/content genres a user will interact with the most, we can personalize recommendations, improve user experience, and increase user engagement and retention.
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Key Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, and similar streaming services.
\item End users (listeners and viewers).
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Key Performance Indicators}

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemTitle{NDCG@10:} Model performance will be evaluated using mean normalized  discounted cumulative gain of the top 10 items (see \cite{H:2023}).
\item \itemTitle{Leaderboard:} Does the model perform well enough to earn a place on the relevant TGB {\href{https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/docs/leader_nodeprop/\#tgbn-genre}{leaderboard}} (see \cite{H_web:2023}).
\item \itemTitle{User engagement:} [Hypothetical.] User engagement metrics such as time spent on platform, number of interactions, feedback, etc.
\item \itemTitle{Retention rate:} [Hypothetical.] Impact of personalized recommendations on user retention and satisfaction.
\item \itemTitle{Business impact:} [Hypothetical.] Increased subscriptions, ad revenue, customer loyalty, etc.
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Proposal Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemTitle{Objective:} Develop a machine learning model to 
predict user interactions with music genres over the next week.
\item \itemTitle{Approach:} Use advanced graph-based algorithms 
to model user behavior patterns and preferences.
\item \itemTitle{Expected outcome:} A scalable and well-performing prediction system that enhances existing recommendation algorithms and drives business growth for streaming platforms.
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Conclusion}

Enhancing recommendation systems through predictive analytics can  revolutionize the user experience in the streaming industry. By leveraging the \href{https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/docs/nodeprop/}{\tt{tgbn-genre}} dataset \cite{tgbn-genre}, we aim to create actionable insights and strategic recommendations that empower businesses to deliver personalized content and stay ahead in a competitive market.
