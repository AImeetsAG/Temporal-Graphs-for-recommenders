\title{Musical preference predictions}

\section{Motivation}

``Nearly 616.2 million people listen to their favorite artists or discover new ones via online streaming platforms" \cite{statista}. Hence, streaming platforms seek to increase enhance the user experience by offering personalized music recommendations. At the same time, music streaming services are able to track individual preferences meticulously, thus, a growing volume of data on  multiple user's musical preferences is available.
In response, we aimed to develop a recommendation model that predicts the genres a user is expected to like.

\section{Datasets}

We worked with a temporal evolving graph from Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) \cite{H:2023} datasets. TGB provides two data sets: First, a graph with 1000 users and 500 music genres represented as nodes and weighted edges that indicates a user listens to a music genre at a given time. The temporal graph evolves over the span of 4 years. The dataset posed a challenge since the description given by the creators of the dataset did not match it. Additionally, it has anomalies and multiple duplicates. A second dataset derives from the first, a dynamical matrix of users and genres where the interaction of each user and each genre is normalized over the span of a week. We train our models on this second dataset. Nevertheless, we explore the first dataset to comprehend the second one.

\section{Approach}

Our primary goal is to predict the the interaction of each user and each genre on the following week. We begin by ...
